# YouTube API Exercise

This app is meant to provide a simple search and sort of videos on YouTube. It is a single page application written in React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Semantic UI React was added for UI styling

To run, you need to change the API Key in App.jsx line 22:
`window.gapi.client.setApiKey('XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');`
